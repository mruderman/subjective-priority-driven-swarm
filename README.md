# Subjective Priority-Driven Swarm (SPDS)

Multi-agent group chat with real Letta agents. Use a modern Web GUI or a friendly CLI to run authentic multi-agent discussions with live minutes and exports.

## Overview

This project implements a multi-agent group chat system using the Subjective Priority-Driven Swarm (SPDS) framework, where AI agents autonomously decide when to contribute to conversations based on internal priority calculations. Built on the Letta platform, it features real computational beings from a Letta ADE server. Available as both a CLI application and a modern web interface, it features intuitive agent selection and multiple conversation modes for rich, dynamic discussions.

**🎉 Major Update**: Successfully completed conversation logic refactor (September 2025) - now featuring dynamic, context-aware agent interactions with natural conversation flow and incremental message delivery.

**Key Innovation**: Agents use their own LLM models to perform real subjective assessment of conversations, creating authentic computational personalities that naturally respond, agree, disagree, and build on each other's ideas. The system now uses recent conversation context instead of static topics for more relevant and engaging interactions.

## 🎭 Conversation Modes

**🔄 Hybrid Mode (Recommended)**: Two-phase conversations
- **Phase 1**: All motivated agents share independent thoughts on an initial topic or question.

- **Phase 2**: Agents respond to each other's ideas with rebuttals, agreements, or new insights

**👥 All-Speak Mode**: Fast-paced group discussions
- All motivated agents respond in priority order
- Each agent sees previous responses within the same turn

**🔀 Sequential Mode**: Traditional turn-taking
- One agent speaks per turn with fairness rotation
- Prevents any single agent from dominating

**🎯 Pure Priority Mode**: Meritocratic discussions
- The most motivated agent always speaks
- Natural leader-follower dynamics

## Quick Start

### Web GUI (recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-web && . .venv-web/bin/activate # Most Linux distros use `python3`, other OSs may use `python`
pip install -r swarms-web/requirements.txt
cd swarms-web && python run.py   # http://localhost:5002
```

### CLI
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m spds.main
```

## Configuration

Set environment variables in a `.env` file:
```bash
LETTA_PASSWORD=your-server-password
LETTA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8283
LETTA_ENVIRONMENT=SELF_HOSTED   # or LETTA_CLOUD
```

See `.env.example` for complete configuration options.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter installation errors with `letta-flask` dependencies, try:
- Use the local shim: run web server from repo root
- Install without dependencies: `pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-flask.git`
