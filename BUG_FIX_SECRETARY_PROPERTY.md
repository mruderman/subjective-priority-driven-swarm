# Bug Fix: Secretary Role Assignment Export Issue

## Summary

Fixed a critical bug where assigning a secretary role via `assign_role()` did not properly enable export functionality. The export handler was checking `if not self.swarm.secretary`, but the `secretary` attribute remained `None` even after role assignment.

## Problem

### Root Cause
1. The `assign_role()` method correctly set `self.secretary_agent_id` when assigning the secretary role
2. However, it did NOT update `self.secretary` attribute
3. Export handlers checked `if not self.swarm.secretary:` which would always be None
4. This caused export to fail with error message even when a secretary was properly assigned

### Impact
- **Web UI**: "Make Secretary" button appeared to work (UI updated correctly)
- **Backend**: Export commands silently failed because `swarm.secretary` was still `None`
- **User Experience**: Confusing - UI shows secretary is active but exports don't work

## Solution

### Implementation
Refactored `secretary` from a simple attribute to a property with getter/setter:

**File**: `spds/swarm_manager.py`

```python
# Changed from:
self.secretary = None  # Simple attribute

# To:
self._secretary = None  # Private attribute with property accessor

@property
def secretary(self):
    """Backward-compatible accessor for secretary.

    Returns:
        - The dedicated SecretaryAgent instance if one was created during init
        - The role-assigned agent (SPDSAgent) if secretary_agent_id is set
        - None if no secretary is assigned
    """
    # Return dedicated SecretaryAgent if it exists (old system)
    if self._secretary is not None:
        return self._secretary
    # Fall back to role-based secretary (new system)
    return self.get_secretary()

@secretary.setter
def secretary(self, value):
    """Set the secretary to a SecretaryAgent instance."""
    self._secretary = value
```

### How It Works
1. **Old System (init-time secretary)**: Returns `_secretary` if it exists
2. **New System (role-based secretary)**: Falls back to `get_secretary()` which looks up by `secretary_agent_id`
3. **Export Checks**: `if swarm.secretary:` now works correctly for both systems

## Testing

### Test Results
Created unit test (`test_secretary_fix.py`) that verified:

✅ Property returns `None` when no secretary assigned
✅ Property returns role-assigned agent after `assign_role()`
✅ Export checks (`if swarm.secretary`) work correctly
✅ Backward compatibility maintained with `_secretary`

### Test Output
```
Testing secretary property fix...
======================================================================

1. Initial State (no secretary):
   swarm._secretary: None
   swarm.secretary_agent_id: None
   swarm.secretary (property): None
   ✓ Export check correctly fails: bool(swarm.secretary) = False

2. Assigning secretary role to Agent One:
   swarm._secretary: None
   swarm.secretary_agent_id: agent-1
   swarm.secretary (property): <MockSPDSAgent object>
   ✓ Export check correctly passes: bool(swarm.secretary) = True
   ✓ Secretary name: Agent One

3. Testing backward compatibility (setting _secretary directly):
   ✓ Old system still works: Direct Secretary

======================================================================
✅ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## Files Modified

1. **spds/swarm_manager.py** (lines 76, 116, 202-220)
   - Changed `self.secretary` to `self._secretary`
   - Added `@property` getter that supports both old and new systems
   - Added `@setter` for backward compatibility

## Verification Steps

### Manual Testing (Web GUI)
1. Start session without secretary ✅
2. Try export → Should show error message ✅
3. Click "Make Secretary" button ✅
4. Try export → Should now work ✅

### Automated Testing
```bash
python test_secretary_fix.py
```

## Related Issues

- Original error message fix: `swarms-web/app.py` lines 285-290 (emit proper error instead of silent failure)
- Role-based secretary system: Implemented in previous commits
- Web UI secretary assignment: `/api/sessions/<session_id>/assign_secretary` endpoint

## Impact Assessment

### Breaking Changes
None - fully backward compatible

### Affected Components
- ✅ SwarmManager secretary property
- ✅ Export functionality (all formats)
- ✅ Secretary status checks throughout codebase
- ✅ Web GUI export buttons
- ✅ CLI export commands

### Edge Cases Handled
- Secretary assigned during init (old system) ✅
- Secretary assigned via role (new system) ✅
- No secretary assigned ✅
- Secretary role transferred between agents ✅
