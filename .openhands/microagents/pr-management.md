# PR Management Microagent

This microagent automatically manages open PR requests in GitHub with a comprehensive workflow for handling code reviews, conflicts, and merging.

## Workflow Overview

This microagent performs the following automated workflow for GitHub pull requests:

### 1. CodeRabbitAI Review Processing

- Monitor for CodeRabbitAI review submissions
- Automatically commit any commitable suggestions from CodeRabbitAI
- Address other concerns and reviewer comments systematically
- Ensure all review feedback is properly handled before proceeding

### 2. Branch Conflict Resolution

- Identify and resolve any outstanding PR branch conflicts with the Main branch
- Perform necessary merges or rebases to ensure clean integration
- Validate that all conflicts are properly resolved before proceeding to merge

### 3. Automated Merging

- Merge PR branch into Main branch once all conditions are met:
  - All conflicts resolved
  - All commitable review suggestions committed
  - All reviewer concerns addressed
- Ensure merge is performed safely with proper validation

### 4. Post-Merge Cleanup

- Delete PR branches after successful merge when safe to do so
- Perform cleanup operations to maintain repository hygiene
- Ensure no orphaned branches remain after successful integration

## Key Features

- **Automated Review Integration**: Seamlessly incorporates CodeRabbitAI suggestions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles merge conflicts automatically where possible
- **Safe Merging**: Validates all conditions before performing merge operations
- **Branch Cleanup**: Maintains clean repository state post-merge
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for edge cases and failures

## Prerequisites

- GitHub repository access with appropriate permissions
- CodeRabbitAI integration configured
- Proper branch protection rules configured
- Access to GitHub API for automated operations

## Safety Considerations

- Always validates merge safety before executing
- Preserves important branch history
- Handles edge cases gracefully
- Provides rollback capabilities when needed
- Respects repository protection rules

## Usage Context

This microagent is designed to work autonomously without manual triggers, monitoring PR states and automatically executing the workflow when appropriate conditions are met. It integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines and respects all repository governance policies.

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of API rate limits
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Fallback procedures for complex conflicts
- Notification systems for manual intervention needs

## Limitations

- Cannot resolve complex merge conflicts requiring human judgment
- Respects branch protection rules and may require manual override
- Limited to repositories with proper permissions configured
- Requires CodeRabbitAI integration for full functionality
