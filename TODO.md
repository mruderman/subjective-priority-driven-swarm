# TODO - SWARMS Project

## Phase 1: Live Testing - COMPLETED! üéâ

### Completed Tasks ‚úì
- [x] Create missing `__init__.py` file in spds/ directory
- [x] Implement environment variable support for API keys
- [x] Fix tool creation method (use `create_from_function` instead of `upsert_from_function`)
- [x] Implement intelligent subjective assessment logic in tools.py
- [x] Clean up all backup files (~) in the project
- [x] Complete the README.md file
- [x] Create creative_swarm.json example file
- [x] Connect to Letta server (https://app.letta.com)
- [x] Test default agent creation with AGENT_PROFILES
- [x] Update model endpoints for all supported providers
- [x] Create diverse model swarms (creative_swarm.json, tool_swarm.json, vision_swarm.json)
- [x] Test live conversations with priority-based turn-taking
- [x] Validate assessment logic with real agents
- [x] Fix tool call issues for agents with default Letta tools
- [x] Successfully test 6 different AI providers:
  - Anthropic (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
  - OpenAI (GPT-4.1)
  - Meta/Together (Llama 3.3 70B)
  - Qwen/Together (Coder 480B)
  - Moonshot/Together (Kimi K2)
  - Mistral/Together (Small 24B)

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Logging System üî¥

### High Priority Tasks

### High Priority Tasks
- [ ] Implement Python logging module with configurable levels
  - [ ] Set up basic logger configuration in config.py
  - [ ] Add environment variable support for log levels
  - [ ] Create formatters for console and file output
  
- [ ] Add structured logging with timestamps and agent identification
  - [ ] Log agent creation and initialization
  - [ ] Log assessment calculations with scores
  - [ ] Log conversation flow and speaker selection
  - [ ] Log API calls to Letta server
  
- [ ] Create rotating log files
  - [ ] Configure RotatingFileHandler
  - [ ] Set appropriate file size and backup count
  - [ ] Add logs/ directory to .gitignore
  
- [ ] Add performance timing for API calls and assessments
  - [ ] Time agent creation
  - [ ] Time assessment calculations
  - [ ] Time LLM response generation
  - [ ] Log slow operations (>5 seconds)

### Tasks Deferred (Custom Tools Complex)
- [ ] Re-enable custom tool attachment with proper JSON schemas
  - Currently using simplified assessment logic
  - Need to implement proper Letta tool schemas

## Medium Priority Tasks üü°
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Network failure recovery
  - Timeout handling for LLM calls
  - Graceful degradation when agents fail
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff

- [ ] Add comprehensive logging system
  - Configure Python logging module
  - Add debug logs for agent assessments
  - Log conversation flow and priority calculations
  - Create rotating log files

- [x] Set up test framework
  - [x] Add pytest configuration
  - [x] Write unit tests for SubjectiveAssessment model
  - [x] Test agent creation and tool attachment
  - [x] Test swarm orchestration logic
  - [x] Add integration tests

## Low Priority Tasks üü¢
- [x] Set up linting configuration
  - [x] Configure flake8 for style checking
  - [x] Set up black for code formatting
  - [x] Configure pylint for code quality
  - [x] Add pre-commit hooks

- [ ] Create detailed API documentation
  - Document all public methods
  - Add usage examples
  - Create architecture diagrams
  - Document the SPDS framework

## Future Enhancements üí°
- [ ] Add support for custom assessment dimensions
- [ ] Implement agent learning from conversation outcomes
- [ ] Add visualization of agent participation patterns
- [ ] Support for saving/loading conversation sessions
- [ ] Web interface for swarm management
- [ ] Integration with other Letta tools (MCP servers, Composio)
- [ ] Support for multi-modal conversations (images, documents)
- [ ] Agent performance analytics and reporting
- [ ] Dynamic agent creation based on conversation needs
- [ ] Support for agent collaboration on specific tasks

## Known Issues üêõ
- [ ] Assessment tool needs to be called through agent message API
- [ ] No validation for agent profile JSON schema
- [ ] Missing handling for agent creation failures
- [ ] No support for resuming interrupted conversations

## Notes üìù
- The project uses Letta's stateful agent framework
- Agents maintain their own conversation history
- Tool execution happens server-side in Letta
- Current implementation uses placeholder assessment logic that should be replaced with actual LLM calls through the agent
